          IdentityServer is a framework and a hostable component that allows implementing single sign-on
          and access control for modern web applications and APIs using protocols like OpenID Connect and OAuth2.
          It supports a wide range of clients like mobile, web, SPAs and desktop applications and is
          extensible to allow integration in new and existing architectures.
