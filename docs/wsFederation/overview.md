# Adding WS-Federation Support

IdentityServer has support for the WS-Federation support for both acting as an identity provider as well
as allowing external authentication over the WS-Federation protocol. For external authentication see [here](../configuration/identityProviders.html).

This section is about adding WS-Federation identity provider capabilities to IdentityServer3.
